            <h5><a href="https://jhell85.github.io/React-Widgets/">React Widgets</a></h5>
            A web app built with ReactJS and Redux to create some simple Widgets that can be reused in other apps (the language converter doesn't work anymore because I stopped paying for the Google API service)

            <h5><a href="https://jhell85.github.io/word-game/">Word Game</a></h5>
            Web app built with ReactJS and Redux that is similar to hangman but built to have a more PG UI design. Instead of showing someone being hung the app displays guesses as hearts. the app has nice hover effects on buttons and elements to make for a more interactive user experience.
