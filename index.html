          Before I started programming I did HVAC Contracting in Gilbert AZ, I
          worked for a few contractors before getting my own Arizona ROC license
          and starting my own company in 2012. I sold the companies customer
          base and contracts to another HVAC contractor before moving to
          Portland.
