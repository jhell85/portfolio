      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Josh a Jr web developer and programmer I've been programing since
        October of 2018 I've worked with many frameworks which include HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, Python and Django. Before I got into
        programming I owned a HVAC contracting company in Gilbert Arizona. I
        sold the company and moved to Portland Oregon to persue a job in tech as
        a programming developer.
